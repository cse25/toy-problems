// Question 13

// It's possible to use the binary search algorithm to find an element in a sorted array in O(log n) time. 
// Binary search trees have this same search performance. Why, then, do we ever use more complicated binary search trees 
// rather than sorted lists?

// a.) BSTs are faster for finding the largest and smallest elements in a set.
// b.) BSTs require less memory than a sorted list.
// c.) BSTs have constant-time access to the median value in a list.
// d.) BSTs are faster for inserting and deleting items.

// solution: d
