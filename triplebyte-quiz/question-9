// Question 9

// Which of the following regular expressions will match blabber but not babel?
// Select the correct answer:

// a.) ^(b?b?)+$
// b.) ^b[l].*e$
// c.) ^b(a|l)+b+e.$
// d.) ^([^b]*b[^b]*){3}$

// solution: d
// Regular expressions are a concise way to express pattern matching over strings. The correct answer above matches strings 
// that have exactly three "b"s. We won't go into the details of regular expression syntax here, but you can look that up online. 
// Interestingly, regular expressions come from theoretical computer science (they are equivalent to finite state automata). 
// And implementing a regular expression engine involves simulating a finite state automaton! They didn't become popular with 
// programmers until 1968, when Ken Thompson used regular expressions as a pattern matching syntax in the QED editor.
